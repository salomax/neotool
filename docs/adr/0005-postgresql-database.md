# ADR-0005: PostgreSQL Database Technology

## Status
Accepted

## Context
NeoTool needs to choose a primary database technology that supports:
- Strong consistency and ACID transactions
- Relational data modeling with foreign keys and constraints
- Flexible data storage for both structured and semi-structured data
- Excellent performance for both read and write operations
- Rich ecosystem and tooling support
- Good integration with the Kotlin + Micronaut backend
- Scalability for growing applications
- Strong community and enterprise support

The database will serve as the primary data store for all NeoTool applications and needs to support both traditional relational data and modern JSON/document use cases.

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL** as the primary database technology.

### Technology Components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Migration Tool**: Flyway
- **ORM**: Micronaut Data (JPA/Hibernate)
- **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP
- **Backup**: pg_dump + automated backups
- **Monitoring**: PostgreSQL metrics via Prometheus

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Schema evolution made sane**: Migrations (Flyway) + typed queries keep data and code aligned
- **JSONB flexibility**: Store unstructured data without giving up SQL joins or indexing
- **Powerful indexing & query planner**: GIN/GIST indexes, parallel execution, and cost-based optimization
- **ACID & transactional safety**: Perfect for financial or enterprise-grade workloads
- **Ecosystem maturity**: Battle-tested with rich tooling (pgAdmin, psql, pgvector, etc.)
- **Integration ready**: Works smoothly with ORM-less frameworks (like Micronaut Data)
- **Hybrid SQL + JSONB engine**: Covers most NoSQL use-cases while keeping strong consistency and relational integrity
- **Excellent performance**: Optimized for both OLTP and OLAP workloads
- **Strong community**: Large, active community with extensive documentation and support

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Developers need to understand PostgreSQL-specific features and optimizations
- **Configuration complexity**: PostgreSQL has many configuration options that need tuning
- **Resource usage**: Can be memory-intensive for large datasets
- **Backup complexity**: Point-in-time recovery and backup strategies require careful planning

### Risks
- **Performance issues**: Poorly designed schemas or queries can lead to performance problems
- **Data corruption**: While rare, database corruption can occur and requires recovery procedures
- **Scaling limitations**: Single-node PostgreSQL has limits, though read replicas and partitioning can help
- **Vendor lock-in**: While PostgreSQL is open source, specific features or extensions might create dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance monitoring**: Use PostgreSQL's built-in monitoring and external tools like Prometheus
- **Regular backups**: Implement automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery
- **Query optimization**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE and query optimization tools
- **Connection pooling**: Configure proper connection pooling to avoid resource exhaustion
- **Regular maintenance**: Implement VACUUM, ANALYZE, and other maintenance tasks

## Problems This Choice Solves
- **Data consistency**: ACID transactions ensure data integrity across complex operations
- **Flexible data modeling**: Support for both relational and document data in a single database
- **Performance**: Excellent query performance with proper indexing and optimization
- **Developer productivity**: Rich tooling and ecosystem make development efficient
- **Scalability**: Can handle growing data volumes with proper architecture
- **Reliability**: Proven track record in production environments

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL
- **Pros**: Popular, good performance, large ecosystem
- **Cons**: Less advanced features, weaker JSON support, more restrictive licensing

### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Excellent for document storage, flexible schema, good scaling
- **Cons**: No ACID transactions across documents, eventual consistency, different query patterns

### DynamoDB
- **Pros**: Managed service, automatic scaling, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited query capabilities, eventual consistency

### SQLite
- **Pros**: Simple, embedded, no server required
- **Cons**: Limited concurrency, not suitable for production web applications

### CockroachDB
- **Pros**: Distributed SQL, strong consistency, PostgreSQL compatible
- **Cons**: More complex setup, higher resource requirements, newer technology

## Decision Drivers
- NeoTool's focus on data consistency and reliability
- Need for both relational and document data storage
- Requirement for strong ACID guarantees
- Desire for excellent performance and scalability
- Need for rich ecosystem and tooling support
- Preference for open-source, vendor-neutral solutions
- Requirement for good integration with Kotlin + Micronaut backend

## Implementation Notes
- Use PostgreSQL 15+ for latest features and performance improvements
- Implement Flyway for database migrations and version control
- Configure proper connection pooling with HikariCP
- Set up automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- Use JSONB columns for flexible document storage
- Implement proper indexing strategies (B-tree, GIN, GIST)
- Configure monitoring and alerting for database performance
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries for security
- Implement proper database security with role-based access control
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Use partitioning for large tables when appropriate
