# ADR-0004: TypeScript + Next.js Frontend Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Context
NeoTool needs to choose a frontend technology stack that supports:
- Type safety across the entire frontend application
- Modern React patterns with excellent developer experience
- Performance optimization and SEO capabilities
- Integration with GraphQL APIs
- Design system and component reusability
- Consistent development experience across web and mobile
- Scalable architecture that can grow with the application

The frontend will serve as the primary user interface for web applications and needs to work seamlessly with the GraphQL backend.

## Decision
We will use **TypeScript + React + Next.js** as the primary frontend technology stack.

### Technology Components
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React 18+
- **Meta-framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Material-UI (MUI) + custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context + custom hooks
- **API Integration**: GraphQL with Apollo Client
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in bundler

## Consequences

### Positive
- **TypeScript-first**: Strict typing across components and GraphQL schemas ensures confidence during refactors and keeps the frontend in sync with the API
- **Next.js (App Router)**: Modern architecture with hybrid rendering (SSR, SSG, ISR), edge runtimes, and built-in routing, caching, and internationalization
- **Design-system ready**: Component-driven UI with shared tokens (MUI + Storybook support) keeps design and engineering aligned
- **Tight backend integration**: GraphQL codegen enforces type safety and prevents schema drift
- **Consistent environments**: Same setup locally and in Docker/K8s â€” no "works on my machine" issues
- **Performance out of the box**: Hybrid rendering + smart caching for fast TTFB and SEO-friendly pages
- **Developer velocity**: Opinionated conventions, hot reload, and unified tooling reduce cognitive load
- **Scalable architecture**: Modular layouts, async data loading, and server/client component boundaries make it easy to grow the app cleanly

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Developers need to understand Next.js App Router patterns and server/client component boundaries
- **Bundle size**: TypeScript and Next.js add some overhead compared to vanilla React
- **Complexity**: More configuration and concepts compared to simple React applications
- **Framework dependency**: Tied to Next.js evolution and decisions

### Risks
- **Next.js changes**: App Router is relatively new and may have breaking changes
- **Performance overhead**: Server-side rendering can add complexity and potential performance issues if not configured properly
- **Bundle size**: Large applications may have significant bundle sizes

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Stay updated**: Keep Next.js and dependencies updated, but test thoroughly
- **Performance monitoring**: Use Next.js built-in analytics and performance monitoring
- **Code splitting**: Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- **Bundle analysis**: Regular bundle size analysis and optimization

## Problems This Choice Solves
- **Type safety**: Prevents runtime errors and improves developer confidence
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for Core Web Vitals and SEO
- **Developer experience**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, and clear error messages
- **Scalability**: App Router provides clear patterns for growing applications
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering and static generation for better search engine optimization
- **Consistency**: Shared components and design system across the application

## Alternatives Considered

### React + Vite
- **Pros**: Faster development server, simpler configuration, smaller bundle
- **Cons**: No built-in SSR/SSG, less opinionated structure, more configuration needed

### Vue.js + Nuxt
- **Pros**: Good performance, built-in SSR, good TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, different patterns from React, less familiar to most developers

### Svelte + SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, smaller bundles, good developer experience
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, different patterns, less familiar to most developers

### Angular
- **Pros**: Enterprise-grade, excellent TypeScript support, comprehensive framework
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, more complex for simple applications, different patterns

### Vanilla React + Create React App
- **Pros**: Simple setup, familiar patterns, large ecosystem
- **Cons**: No built-in SSR/SSG, more configuration needed, less performance optimization

## Decision Drivers
- NeoTool's focus on developer velocity and type safety
- Need for performance optimization and SEO capabilities
- Requirement for scalable architecture that can grow
- Desire for consistent development experience
- Need for tight integration with GraphQL backend
- Preference for modern React patterns and best practices

## Implementation Notes
- Use Next.js App Router for all new applications
- Implement server components where appropriate for performance
- Use client components for interactive features
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- Set up GraphQL codegen for type-safe API integration
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use Next.js built-in internationalization for multi-language support
- Configure proper caching strategies for static and dynamic content
- Implement proper SEO with Next.js metadata API
